# UserFrosting 6 Payment Sprinkle - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This sprinkle provides a complete payment processing solution for UserFrosting 6 applications with support for multiple payment gateways.

## Architecture

### Database Layer

```
orders (main order table)
├── order_lines (line items)
├── payments (payment transactions)
    └── payment_details (detailed payment info)
```

**Key Features:**
- Soft deletes on all major tables

- Multiple payments per order support
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

### Application Layer

- `Payment.php` - Payment transactions with status tracking
- `PaymentDetail.php` - Extended payment information

#### Repositories (app/src/Database/Repositories/)
- `OrderRepository.php` - Order CRUD operations
- `PaymentRepository.php` - Payment CRUD operations

#### Services (app/src/Services/)
- `PaymentService.php` - Main payment orchestration service
- `PaymentProcessorInterface.php` - Contract for payment processors
- Payment Processors:

## API Endpoints

### Orders

- `GET /api/payment/orders` - List orders
- `GET /api/payment/orders/{id}` - Get order details

### Payments
- `POST /api/payment/payments` - Process payment

## Testing

- Unit tests for Order and Payment models
- PHPUnit configuration with coverage support

- Payment processor isolation
- Transaction tracking
- Refund verification

## Extensibility

The sprinkle is designed to be easily extended:

1. **Add new payment processors**: Implement `PaymentProcessorInterface`
2. **Customize order workflow**: Extend `Order` model
3. **Add webhooks**: Create new controllers
4. **Modify UI**: Override Twig templates

## Integration Example

```php
// In your UserFrosting app
use UserFrosting\Sprinkle\Payment\Payment;

// Add to sprinkles list
return [
    // ... other sprinkles
    Payment::class,
];
```

```twig
{# In your template #}
{% include '@payment/components/payment/widget.html.twig' with {
    'order_id': order.id,
    'amount': order.total
} %}
```
